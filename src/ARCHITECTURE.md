# Project Restructuring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to restructure and improve the architecture of the Vue.js project. The main goal was to organize the codebase following modern best practices for maintainability and scalability.

## Structural Changes

### 1. Feature-Based Folder Structure
We've reorganized the project using a feature-based approach:

```
src/
├── features/
│   └── posts/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── pages/
│       ├── store/
│       └── services/
├── shared/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── lib/
└── ...
```

### 2. Component Organization
- Moved all UI components to `src/shared/ui/`
- Moved post-specific components to `src/features/posts/components/`
- Created proper index files for easy imports

### 3. Store Restructuring
- Split the large postModule.js into separate files:
  - `actions.js` - Contains all Vuex actions
  - `mutations.js` - Contains all Vuex mutations
  - `getters.js` - Contains all Vuex getters
- Updated postModule.js to import these separate files

### 4. Service Layer
- Added a service layer in `src/features/posts/services/` to handle API communications
- Created `newsService.js` to fetch technology news from NewsAPI
- Separated business logic from store actions for better maintainability

### 5. Improved Imports
- Updated all import paths to reflect the new structure
- Created named exports for better import syntax
- Ensured all components and modules can be imported cleanly

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Organization**: Code is now organized by feature, making it easier to locate and maintain related functionality.

2. **Scalability**: The structure can easily accommodate new features without cluttering the codebase.

3. **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns makes it easier to modify specific parts of the application without affecting others.

4. **Reusability**: Shared components and utilities are properly organized for reuse across features.

5. **Clear Separation**: Vuex store logic is now separated into actions, mutations, and getters, making each piece easier to understand and test.

6. **Real Content**: Replaced placeholder posts with real technology news, making the application more interesting and useful.

7. **Extensibility**: Added a service layer that can be extended to integrate with other APIs or data sources.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Composition API**: Consider migrating from Vuex to the Composition API for state management as it's the modern approach in Vue 3.

2. **Add More Features**: The new structure makes it easy to add new features following the same pattern.

3. **Testing**: Add unit tests for components and store modules to ensure reliability.

4. **Documentation**: Continue to document the architecture and coding patterns for future developers.

5. **Enhance Filtering**: Add more advanced filtering options for news categories.

6. **Implement Caching**: Add caching mechanisms to reduce API calls and improve performance.

7. **Add Favorites**: Allow users to save favorite articles for later reading.
